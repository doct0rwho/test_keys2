As the electrical industry faces growing pressure to upskill new workers, reduce training costs, and improve assessment consistency, MITA has remained committed to innovation. ",

          "text_0": "MITA's classrooms had few physical test boards and meters, limiting hands\u2011on training. Trainees had to wait for equipment, hindering their practice and wasting instructors' time on resetting rigs. ",

          "text_1": "Early mistakes on live switchboards can embed bad habits\u00A0— or cause real harm. MITA flagged the “high-risk learning environment where mistakes could cause confusion or unsafe habits,” especially for novices practising fault-loop and polarity checks.",
