					<h2>19. Arbitration Agreement and Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver; and Forum Selection Clause.</h2>
					<p>If you are a resident of Ukraine (including its possessions and territories), you agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Metaenga or its successors or assigns, including any disputes as to this clause, arbitrability of the disputes, or application of the demand to arbitrate made in any judicial proceeding (collectively “Arbitrability Disputes”) shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.</p>
					<p>Arbitration shall be subject to the Arbitration Act and not any state or provincial/territorial arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the Ukraine Arbitration Association (“UAA”). As modified by these Terms and unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the UAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).</p>
					<p>In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus agreeing to give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.</p>
					<p>In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and Metaenga must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR Metaenga MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Metaenga will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (d) Metaenga also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (h) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing Party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either Party may seek emergency equitable relief before courts located in Ukraine in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Ukraine for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
					<p>If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in court located in Ukraine.</p>
