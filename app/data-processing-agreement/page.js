						(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. <br />

						<li>
							<p>
								The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><u><b>Clause 8</b></u> <br />
						<b>Cooperation with supervisory authorities</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><u><b>Clause 9</b></u> <br />
						<b>Governing Law</b></p>
					<p>
						The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
					</p>
					<p><u><b>Clause 10</b></u> <br />
						<b>Variation of the contract</b></p>
					<p>
						The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
					</p>
					<p><u><b>Clause 11</b></u> <br />
						<b>Sub-processing</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under such agreement.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><u><b>Clause 12</b></u> <br />
						<b>Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
